# Miscellaneous ACCRE Programs, Scripts, and Utilities

Are you running a program or script on the cluster that you think other cluster users may find useful? If so, you can contribute it to this repository for others to use! This is a great way to foster collaboration in computational research at Vanderbilt.

Note that there are already ACCRE GitHub repositories for Python (), R (), Matlab (), Ruby (), and SLURM (), it's up to you to decide where the best fit is.

## Contributing a New Example

Fork this repository and add a subdirectory containing your example. You can then commit and push the changes to your fork of the respository, and submit a pull request to the ACCRE repository. After reviewing your files, we can then merge your changes into the ACCRE repository for other users to access.
