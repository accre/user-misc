# Miscellaneous ACCRE Programs, Scripts, and Utilities

Are you running a program or script on the cluster that you think other cluster users may find useful? If so, you can contribute it to this repository for others to use! This is a great way to foster collaboration in computational research at Vanderbilt.

Note that there are already ACCRE GitHub repositories for Python (https://github.com/accre/Python), R (https://github.com/accre/R), Matlab (https://github.com/accre/Matlab), Ruby (https://github.com/accre/Ruby), and SLURM (https://github.com/accre/SLURM). There is also a Big Data Vanderbilt organization (https://github.com/bigdata-vandy) where you can contribute new repositories with examples of running software in the Hadoop ecosystem. It's up to you to determine the best fit for your example! 

## Contributing a New Example

Fork this repository and add a subdirectory containing your example. You can then commit and push the changes to your fork of the respository, and submit a pull request to the ACCRE repository. After reviewing your files, we can then merge your changes into the ACCRE repository for other users to access. More detailed instructions can be found on our website: http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu/?page_id=2735
