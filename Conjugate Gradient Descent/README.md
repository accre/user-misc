# Conjugate Gradient Descent Algorithm

This folder contains the code of Conjugate Gradient Descent Algorithm for energy minimization on 3d sphere.

To compile the code, use terminal and make command inside the main folder. Need a input text file named control.inp. The style and format is strictly required. The output files are coordinates of points on 3d sphere. 

We created several data structure to increase the speed. The main algorithm including a line search can be found in Descent.c.

This code is developed by students who worked for Professor Doug Hardin several years ago and fixed by Ziqi Yang in 2016 summer.
